##### John Wick
The story follows former hitman John Wick and his attempt to hunt down the men who broke into his home, stole his vintage car, and killed his puppy, which was a last gift to him from his recently deceased wife. Stahelski and David Leitch directed the film together, though only Stahelski was credited.
